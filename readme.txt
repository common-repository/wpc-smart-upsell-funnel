= Smart Upsell Funnels =

Building practical and efficient upsell funnels requires proper strategies namely item choice, promotions, selection settings, etc. With this plugin, store owners have everything at hand to offer better product suggestions that can  boost customers’ shopping drives and successfully convert into more sales.

Product sources are truly diverse: users can describe applicable items in groups from small to large in size using product types, tags, categories, brands, collections, attributes, shipping classes, visibility, etc. Especially, with the Combined source, it’s possible to describe them at a higher level to precisely target the product groups you want by combining several sources for each rule.

Complex conditions can be configured easily: in addition to cart content conditions (cart subtotal, total and count), the Premium version brings about Date/Time conditions & User Roles features so that business owners can manage the accessibility and membership of specific products and services.

Discounts or New prices are set by a fixed number or a percentage: Users can configure a new price or discounts for the matched upsell items. These prices will take effect only when all conditions of a rule are met. It can be considered as a great tool to offer free gift(s) or low-price items based on cart count or cart total/subtotal - a special case of dynamic pricing on the cart page.

Custom quantity & selection method can be enabled or disabled per rule: Buyers can choose the quantity of upsell items on the cart and checkout pages based on the selection method configurations (multiple or single selection) set by the sellers.

Flexible upsell offers on cart and checkout pages: There are different positions available for placing the upsell product slider on the cart and checkout forms. Depending on the structure of cart and checkout pages on your site, it’s easy to choose a place that catches the best attention from visitors and clients for each. Giving each rule a custom name makes it easier for users to preview all rules from the Upsells tab and make proper adjustments for particular marketing campaigns.

Dynamic item prices on cart: Remarkably, WPC Smart Upsell Funnel for WooCommerce offers dynamic price features on the cart page. When customers remove some products from cart making the upsell conditions not fully satisfied, our plugin will automatically remove the discounts or new prices then change the prices of upsell items back to the regular one.

= One-click Order Bumps =

An essential part of the effective sale funnel is to persuade buyers with one order bump offer before the final payment. Users can create multiple rules from the WPClever menu >> Order Bump tab. There will be one unique product that satisfies all the conditions to be selected as the last offer for customers to add to order before they close the deal.

With the convenient one-click order bump feature, users can literally “bump” the order value before buyers make their decisions. What’s called “One-click Order Bump” is that customers can easily choose to add the suggested item to or remove from the order when they change their mind in just one click. Once again, it’s important to emphasize that the subtotal and total can be automatically updated upon checking or unchecking the order bump item without the need for buyers to refill their payment details and billing address. Hence, the order bump offer won’t cause any negative influences to the purchase flow of your customers at all.

Order Bump tab shares the same mechanism with the Upsell Funnel. Users that are familiar with how our plugins work will have no difficulty in setting up these:

- Multiple product sources: cart conditions, tags, types, brands, collections, attributes, visibility and shipping classes, etc.
- Date/Time conditions (Premium) & User Roles (Premium) for higher management.
- Order Bump item: sources, product filters, new price (in number and percentage)
- Configure the appearance: enable or disable image, short description and name individually
- Shortcode supported: insert [wpcuf_ob] to place the order bump in any place you want

Users can customize the promotion text and checkbox label of the order bump section to ensure it’s catchy and appealing enough for buyers to grab the chance. Your customers won’t need to switch back and forth since there will be the full product name, featured image, short description and Quick View popup integrated for the chosen item.

One special feature is that both Upsell Funnel & Order Bump are made to work with the Fly Cart popup and other mini-cart widget properly. What’s more, Premium users of WPC Fly Cart plugin can enable the order bump within the Instant Checkout form right on the popup easily.
